        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>We are Nouille Cellars, a very small, startup winery.
          We are currently making only small batch wines of 5-10 gallons, but hope
          to buy our first batch of grapes next year in 2021.  While we hope that soon
          we will be producing some red grape wine next year, we are currently in the process
          of making some great fruit wines, and even some assorted grape wines made from
          juice.  To learn more about what we are making, check out our
          <a href="making.html">What We're Making</a> page.</P>
          <h1>The First Club Release is Ready!</h1>

          margin-left:25px; margin-right:25px; margin-bottom:25px; border:solid 1px black; box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px;">
          <p>That's right, the first two Nouille Cellars bottles are labeled and ready to go, and a big shout out
            and thank you to our member Saumya Santosh for designing the lables, they are beautiful!</p><br>
          <p>The two bottles being released are our 2019 Blackberry and 2020 Peach Mango.  If you are as excited as we
            are for these two, feel free to get a sneak peak at the back label description on the <a href="making.html">
            What We're Making</a> page.</p><br>
          <p>We will be sending out our first email to everyone shortly, in fact seeing that email could be the reason you found this
            page!  Once we send it out we will also be sending out the invoice for the release.  Please note that we might do this a little
            different than other wineries.  Rather than keeping your card on file and charging you quarterly, we will send out an automated invoice
            directly to your emails on file.  Please remember to login and pay the invoice prior to pickup or shipping.  This will help everyone as you
            go through life and inevitably replace cards, as you won't have to worry about updating them with us!  In case anyone is concerned, our invoicing and
            POS will be through Square, a service I think we are all fairly familiar with these days.</p><br>

          <h1 style="clear:left;">Custom Small batches also available!</h1>
          <p>We have also been known to make custom small batches of wine to order.  These
            kinds of batches are great for weddings and other special events.  You can pick the type(s)
            of wine, taste the wine throughout the process if you'd like, even name it and design your own
            label.  Remember though that wine takes a little while to make, so don't wait!  <a href="contact.html">Contact Us</a> today
            to schedule a free consultation on what it would take to get your own custom wine to your event.</p>
