        <h1>Join the Noodle Club!</h1>
        <p>Currently our only available club option, this one won't be open long!  This club is designed for "ground floor" members
          and will likely close when we reach somewhere between 24-36 members.  Here is what you need to know about the Noodle Club:</P>
        <br>
        <ul id="clubList">
          <li>Receive 2 bottles a quarter for only $40 each quarter.  Right now we are only
             making small batch wines, most of which for the first year will be fruit wines, followed by small batch
           grape wines in 2021.</li>
           <li>Quarterly shipments are scheduled for the second half of February, May, July, and October.  Note that
             the first release will be the July 2020 release, but will actually be in August to allow one of the wines
             a little bit more time before releasing.</li>
            <li>Club members get first access to any additional bottles they might want when they are released, at a special club price.
              This will typically be $20, the same as the per bottle cost for the quarterly release, but we will let you know if that is not
              the case for any particular wine.</li>
            <li>The goal with the Noodle Club is to keep this quarterly deal even as we progress into making larger batch grape wines!  That means that
              when we get to the point where we are making higher price point wines, the Noodle Club will receive those bottles for the same $40 in the future.
              Of course, you would be free to add on any other memberships that you might find appealing as well, after all, we haven't planned everything out yet!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Sound good?  One day we will figure out a way for you to submit things via the website, but for now, if you are interested in joining please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>!  Remember, 
          there are so many spots available in the Noodle Club!</p>
