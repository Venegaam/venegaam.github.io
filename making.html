          These are the wines we currently have somewhere in the process between
          sitting in a box as juice, concentrate, or whatever, and being drank by you.
          If a wine is on this page it is either available for purchase, or in some cases
          expected to be delivered to club members only in a future release.  Some were
          made before I kept studious records of all my wine, and some before I could even
          get a good reading on acidity, so not all wines have complete information.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Thoughout the process I will endeavor to keep this page updated with the progress and
          my thoughts about the wines so far.  We always hold back a few bottles to drink ourselves
          over time so that we can see how they are aging, so be sure to check back from time to time,
          even if you have already read about one of the wines you already have.  We may be able to update
          our notes to even include a recommendation on when to drink it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Have your own thoughts about the wine?  Please feel free to let us know what you think by
          <a href="contact.html">contacting us</a>.  You never know, your thoughts or notes could even
          make it onto this webpage.

          <p>Made before I kept really good records of my winemaking activities,
            or had the equipment to accurately test acidity, this grape wine made from
            concentrated juice is the oldest in the collection.  The only way to get ahold
            of one of these though, is to be a club member, and wait for the release!

          Made with the same way as my original batch of wine, this wine also pre-dates
          my superb record keeping and acidity testing.  Like the Pinot Noir, this one will
          only be available to club members when the time comes to release it.

          My idea of a summer dream wine!  Although young, this one is aging quickly,
          and tasting good.  Not too much acid, so far the peach is really coming out
          with a hint of mango on the back, but I will keep you posted as we go.

          Very yummy despite being very acidic.  This wine is made from grape juice concentrate, but is an actual
          grape wine.  Sadly since it is from a concentrate I won't be able to tell you what kind of grape it is a rose
          of, but that shouldn't make it any less enjoyable should it?  This wine needs an eye kept on the acidity as it ages,
           and perhaps will have to be deacidified later, as the acid is just a little too high for my taste.

          Also coming out very acidic, I think I learned my lesson about messing with the
          acidity while the wine is still a must (that is the unfermented juice prior to fermenting
          for those who don't know).  Although it also may need to be deacidified, this wine is not
          the gold color I had originally envisioned.  Although just out of the fermenter a couple weeks ago,
           and still in need of settling, this wine so far appears to have a brownish color to it.  I wonder
           if that is on the wine color charts anywhere.

          Just started and still fermenting, this red grape wine is new to me.  Having never drank
          a carmenere I am excited to get this one out of the fermenter and have a taste.  Although it
           still has a long way to go, I think this is one to be excited about in the future.
